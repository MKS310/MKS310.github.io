# Hardware and Software Guide!!

I was buying another external harddrive the other day and began thinking about how I could optimize my at-home data-science set-up. Where should I store my data? Should I use cloud resources? how do I stay organized? How do I optimize the processing power that I have? Do I need more? How is my hardware limiting my number crunching activities?

## Set Up Your Hardware

Let's start from the bottom up, with your hardware. You need to be able to process large amounts of data locally. Sure, you can use cloud resources, which we will talk about, but you want to be able to do some of the heavy lifting yourself. If you rely 100% on cloud resources, you will be at the mercy of having a network connection, and your wallet. Cloud computing is not expensive, but you don't want to pay for it unless you have to and definitely not for just playing around with data.

###Considerations
-laptop or desktop



-dual core or quad core

-RAM

-r/w operations on SSD

-GPU considerations for intense graphical analysis?
