Hello! My name is Maggie and I currently work on UNIX and Windows systems (*NIX preferred). I am also working toward a Master's of Science in Data Science via the University of Wisconsin--La Crosse. I am writing this blog to document my adventures as a Linux user, Systems Administrator and student of Data Science.


2012 Graduation from University of Wisconsin-Platteville (B.S. Mathematics)
### Work Experience

**United States Property and Fiscal Office**
*Camp Douglas, WI
Title: IT Specialist(SYSADMIN, GS-11-2210)
I am a systems administrator for multiple systems including a document management system and our entire insurance management system that processes billions of dollars in transactions annually. I support over 250 users, provide Tier Level 1, 2 and 3 support, and create documentation on IT processes for the knowledge base. I work with members of management to understand their needs and use the information contained in SQL databases to design mission critical reports for each of five Profit Centers. These reports drive business activities including productivity reports for each department to measure performance and ensure compliance with the law. I improved the book of business report to accurately reflect Producer commissions and credits and company revenue; I automated processes for each department saving practice leaders a cumulative 2000 hours of annual manpower. I meticulously schedule and maintain documentation on processes in order to increase production efficiency. I implement information assurance practices by monitoring and processing system security logs in weekly, monthly and annual increments that supports the organization's mission and ensures industries best practices standards.

**Wisconsin National Guard**
Title: Signal (Communications) Officer
I am responsible for communications and automation operations, management, and security. I manage a mobile data center for the military.  We connect to DISA, units and/or other organizations using various technologies by satellite, fiber, wireless and/or wide area networks.  I ensure my personnel are using the latest industry as well as Army standards.  These TTPs implements the latest NSA security best practices by the use of encryption, cyber security services, authentication services, virtual private networks (VPN) and network detection devices.

I plan, manage, and direct communications operations to include establishment of communications networks and systems and installation and maintenance of equipment.I coordinate integration of battalion communications systems into those of a supported maneuver/FA unit and a FA HQ.

I prepare communications estimates and write the signal operation plan

###Academic Achievements
**Masters of Science in Data Science**  University of Wisconsin Fall 2015-Present


**Signal Basic Officer Leadership Course**	Cyber Leader College	Oct. 2014 - March 2015 (Graduated)
During the four-month course, I studied Signal Theory, Information Technology, WIN-T architecture and Signal Core where I helped plan and setup various networking technologies across many different platforms. I studied networking from the single user level all the way to the Brigade level that would include hooking up satellites and antennas to move voice and data across hundreds of kilometers. I developed an IP scheme and mapped the LAN/WAN configuration for an entire brigade. This included separate SIPR and NIPR routers utilizing tunneled VPNs for security. Also for security, we installed and configured ACLs on the firewalls and IPS/IDS servers. Through self-study throughout this course, I have gained experience with Linux, and Unix based operating systems through the command line interface.  In addition, I wrote some basic scripts in order to automate processes in the Linux and Unix operating systems.  I have also used Microsoft SharePoint to post and update the portal web site.  I am MOSQ’d as a 25A.

**WIARNG Officer Candidate School**	426th RTI	Apr. 2013 - Oct. 2014 (Graduated)
During OCS, I held leadership roles as the Physical Training Chair, Esprit de Corps Chair and Newsletter/Yearbook Chair.  As the Newsletter Chair, I created a monthly newsletter using computer programs such as Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe Acrobat. I planned, created and manipulated the content monthly, developing templates and automated processes in order to streamline the production process. I set up a photo hosting website to serve as the Yearbook for the class and organized the use of computer file sharing sites to share information among class members. Throughout the course, I was in charge of developing and presenting on multiple historical and technical topics, along with teaching tactics and leading monthly PT. I gained experience in planning the sequence of actions necessary to accomplish the mission. I studied the fundamentals of military leadership, Army management systems and Army operations. I demonstrated knowledge of the orders process and troop leading procedures (TLPs) while executing small unit tactics. 

**University of Wisconsin-Platteville**	Bachelors of Science in Mathematics		Jan. 2011- Dec. 2012 (Graduated)
I studied mathematical theories, algorithm development, logic, physics, chemistry and computer science. My program of study included four semesters of Calculus, three semesters of statistics, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Modern Algebra and one year of object-oriented computer programming in Java and C++ using NetBeans and HiC programming environments. While writing computer programs, I analyzed algorithms and sequences in order to increase efficiency. I used the MiniTab computer program extensively for in-depth data processing in Advanced Statistics courses. This included analyzing raw data to find patterns and algorithms that would then be used to make predictions and automate decision-making, such as in cost/benefit analysis. I also used Microsoft Excel for data processing/analysis in Physics, three semesters of lab-based Chemistry, Biology and multiple Math classes. 

**Northeast Iowa Community College**	Associates of Science	May 2009 - Dec. 2010 (Graduated)
I took my general education requirements at NICC, obtaining a 3.65 GPA. My studies included one year of computer classes: Data Processing/Computer Hardware classes and Web Design classes. I studied the interrelationships of the components of the computer system. I used Adobe Dreamweaver to create a website from scratch which I maintained on Webs hosting site. I also created two websites as part of a creative presentation/book report and research project during the course of a Latin American studies course. When creating web sites, I carefully managed the sequence of programs to be processed by the computer with a view to production efficiency.
